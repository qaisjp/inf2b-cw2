function [CM, acc] = my_confusion(Ctrues, Cpreds)
% Input:
%   Ctrues : N-by-1 ground truth label vector
%   Cpreds : N-by-1 predicted label vector
% Output:
%   CM : K-by-K confusion matrix, where CM(i,j) is the number of samples whose target is the ith class that was classified as j
%   acc : accuracy (i.e. correct classification rate)
