This checklist consists of the following three sections.
  Section 1: Directory structure in your submission
  Section 2: Files to submit
  Section 3: Contents of reports

===== Section 1 Directory structure ====================================

All the files for Inf2b CW2 submission should be saved in the directory
named "LearnCW", whose directory structure should be as follows.

|-- LearnCW 
   |-- report_task1.pdf
   |-- report_task2.pdf
   |-- report_task3.pdf
   |-- Task1
      |-- (all files for Task1 except the report)
   |-- Task2
      |-- (all files for Task2 except the report)
   |-- Task3
      |-- (all files for Task3 except the report)

  NB: * Please do NOT include the provided data set file (data.mat).
      * Helper functions you created may be placed in the corresponding task
        directory or its parent directory, i.e., LearnCW. 
      * Directory and file names are case sensitive. Those in your
        submission should be exactly the same as specified.

===== Section 2 Files to submit ====================================

NB:
 - The following list shows the minimal set of files that you need to
   submit, and it does not include other relevant files you created, which you
   are also required to submit.
 - For Python users, replace the Matlab function/script file extension ".m"
   with ".py".  Those files with ".mat" extension are of Matlab MAT-file,
   whose format you should follow.
 - Matlab template files for some of the functions to submit are available in
      /afs/inf.ed.ac.uk/group/teaching/inf2b/cwk2/matlab_codes
   Please make sure your code follows the function syntax defined in
   the templates. 
   For Python, replace 'matlab_codes' in the above path with 'python_codes'.
 - Do not include the provided data set file in your submission.
   In your code, use the absolute path name for the data set file in DICE.
